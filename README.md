## Description

MQTT GDS Connector is a PLCnext Technology component, that exchanges data between Global Data Space (GDS) ports and MQTT server topics. 

![PLCnext Engineer Port Example](images/PLCnEng_Port_Example.jpg)

The component is configured with the file `mqtt_gds.settings.json` which is stored localy on the device. 

```json
{ "brokers":[{
    "host": "tcp://test.mosquitto.org:1883",
    "client_name": "MQTT_Test_App",
	"status_port": "Arp.Plc.Eclr/TestBench1.MQTT_Broker_Status",
    "connect_options":{
      "will_options":{
        "topic": "last_will_topic",
        "payload": "auf wiedersehen"
      }
    },
    "publish_data":[{
      "port"   : "Arp.Plc.Eclr/TestBench1.PubLoadTestBool",
      "qos": 0,
      "retained": false,
      "topics" :[
        "LoadTestBool"
      ]
    }
],
    "subscribe_data":[{
      "topic" : "LoadTestBool",
      "ports" :[
        "Arp.Plc.Eclr/TestBench1.SubLoadTestBool"
      ]
    }
]
  }]
}
```

The entries in this file must conform to the defined JSON schema (please refer for more details the chapter "configuration"). 

**Note:** Every invalid configuration (invalid schema or missing mandatory fields) leads to a stop of the app. Debug information will be printed into the output.log file of the plc.

`/opt/plcnext/logs/output.log`


## Requirements

* AXC F 2152 with minimum firmware version 2019.3
* Valid account for the PLCnext Store with payment credentials (not needed for the trial version)
* The PLCnext Control must be connected to the internet and must be registered in the PLCnext Store

## Features

* The MQTT Client app is compatible with version 3.1 and 3.1.1
* Support of TCP and Websockets over an unencrypted or an encrypted (SSL/TLS) connection
* Automatic reconnect to the MQTT Broker
* Easy handling due to GDS port mapping, no further configuration effort
* Cyclic update of Publish Topics, individually adjustable (minimum 500ms)
* Support of the following data types* (Bool, Int8, Int16, Int32, Int64, Uint8, Uint16, Uint32, Uint64, Real32, Real64, String**, DateTime)


**The named data types are representing the C++ conventions, please refer the PLCnext Technology Handbook (available in the [PLCnext Community]((https://plcnext-community.net))) for the correct representetives in IEC 61131-3 or in Matlab<sup>&trade;</sup> Simulink.*  
***String data is always published with a terminating NULL character. When subscribing to String data, incoming message payloads must always include a terminating NULL character.*



## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome.

## Building from source

Building from source requires the PLCnext SDK for your target. It is strongly recommended that you use the PLCnext Command Line Interface (CLI) to install and manage PLCnext SDKs on your host. Assistance with this is available from the [PLCnext Community]((https://plcnext-community.net)).

An example of a build session is as follows:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/PLCnext/MqttGdsConnector
$ cd MqttGdsConnector
$ cmake -G "Ninja" 
> -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/opt/pxc/sdk/AXCF2152/2019.3/toolchain.cmake
> -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF
> -DUSE_ARP_DEVICE=ON
> -DCMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX=/home/tcs-user/Documents/projects/MqttGdsConnector/bin/axcf2152
> -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local
> -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/home/tcs-user/Documents/projects/MqttGdsConnector/external/deploy/axcf2152
> -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON
> -DARP_TOOLCHAIN_ROOT=/opt/pxc/sdk/AXCF2152/2019.3
> -DARP_DEVICE=AXCF2152 "-DARP_DEVICE_VERSION=2019.3 (19.3.0.18161)"
> -S . -B ./build/axcf2152-2019.3
$ cmake --build /home/tcs-user/Documents/projects/MqttGdsConnector/build/axcf2152-2019.3 --config Debug --target all -- -j 3
$ cmake --build /home/tcs-user/Documents/projects/MqttGdsConnector/build/axcf2152-2019.3 --config Debug --target install -- -j 3
```

## Installing manualy
**Note:** The follwoing steps are only needed when you build the application by yourself without using the PLCnext Store. Phoenix Contact recommend the usage of the PLCnext Store.

**Note:** The MQTT GDS Connector uses the Remote Service Call (RSC) service published by the MQTT Client component, which must be running on the target.
When the MQTT Client app is deployed via the PLCnext Store are the needed RSC services automaticaly deployed and loaded. 

1. Copy the contents of `external/deploy/axcf2152` to `/usr/local` on the target.
1. Copy `libGdsConnector.so` to `/usr/local/lib` on the target.
1. Copy `libs/MqttGdsConnector.acf.config` to `/opt/plcnext/projects/Default` on the target.
1. Copy the file `mqtt_gds.schema.json` to `/opt/plcnext/apps/60002172000048/` on the target.
1. Copy a valid configuration file named `mqtt_gds.settings.json` to `/opt/plcnext/projects/MqttClient` on the target.
1. Reboot the target.

## Quick start

This example exchanges data between a PLC (MQTT Client) and an iPhone* or iPad* (both MQTT Clients) via a public MQTT broker, over an unencrypted connection. It requires a PLC that is connected to the internet, and a PC with access to both the PLC and the internet. For this example, the PC must have PLCnext Engineer software installed.

**There are many other free MQTT Test Clients for Android, Windows or Linux available*

1. Make sure that your AXC F 2152 has a firmware >=2019.3 and that it has an internet connection
1. Register yourself and your AXC F 2152 in the PLCnext Store (www.plcnextstore.com) - not necessary when the app is installed manualy
1. Deploy the app via the PLCnext Store (recommend) or manualy
1. Create an IEC 61131 project in PLCnext Engineer version 2019.3, with the following configuration:
   - One AXC F 2152 PLC with firmware version >=2019.0
   - one program called "Main"
   - one program OUT port called "PubMessage" of type STRING
   - one program IN port called "SubMessage" of type STRING
   - one instance of the Main program, called "MainInstance"
1. Download the PLCnext Engineer project to the PLC.
1. Go online to the PLC and change the value of the "PubMessage" variable in the "MainInstance" program instance.
1. Install the [MQTTool app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mqttool/id1085976398) on an iPhone or iPad.
1. Open the MQTTool app and connect to the public Mosquitto test broker (test.mosquitto.org, port 1883).
1. On a PC, create a text file named `mqtt_gds.settings.json`, containing the following configuration:

   ```json
   {
     "brokers":[{
       "host": "tcp://test.mosquitto.org:1883",
       "client_name": "MyPLCnext",
       "connect_options":{
         "will_options":{
           "topic": "last_will_topic",
           "payload": "auf wiedersehen"
         }
       },
       "publish_data":[{
         "port"   : "Arp.Plc.Eclr/MainInstance.PubMessage",
         "qos"    : 0,
         "retained": false,
         "topics" :[
           "MyPubTopic"
         ]
       }],
       "subscribe_data":[{
         "topic" : "MySubTopic",
         "ports" :[
           "Arp.Plc.Eclr/MainInstance.SubMessage"
         ]
       }]
     }]
   }
   ```
   In the configuration file, change the `client_name` property to a value that is likely to be unique on a public server.

   Change the publish and subscribe `topic` properties to values that are likely to be unique on a public server.
1. Using WinSCP (Windows) or `scp` (Linux), copy the `mqtt_gds.settings.json` file to the following directory on the PLC: `/opt/plcnext/projects/MqttClient/`. Create this directory on the PLC if it does not exist already.

   The default login credentials for the PLC are:
   - User name : admin
   - Password  : &lt;printed on the PLC housing&gt;


1. Restart the PLC.
1. In the MQTTool app on the iPhone or iPad, subscribe to the topic name that was entered in the `publish_data` section of the configuration file (e.g. "MyPubTopic").
1. The messages received on the iPhone or iPad now show the value of the PubMessage variable in the PLC.
1. On the iPhone or iPad, publish a message to the topic that was entered in the `subscribe_data` section of the configuration file (e.g. "MySubTopic"). This message now appears as the value of the SubMessage variable in the PLC.


## Configuration reference

The MQTT GDS Client is configured with the file `mqtt_gds.settings.json`. This file must be located in the following directory on the PLC:

`/opt/plcnext/projects/MqttClient/`

This directory must be created on the PLC if it does not exist already.

For encrypted connections, a server certificate, client certificate and client private key may be required. These files should be copied to the PLC using WinSCP (Windows) or scp (Linux). The user is free to place these files anywhere on the PLC file system. The absolute path to these files must then be specified in the relevant `ssl_options` configuration fields.

All changes to the configuration are only effective after a restart of the PLC.


### Configuration scheme

The configuration file `mqtt_gds.settings.json` must comply with the JSON schema defined in the file `mqtt_gds.schema.json`. This schema file must be located in the following directory on the PLC:

`/opt/plcnext/apps/60002172000048/`

**Note:** Every invalid configuration (invalid schema or missing mandatory fields) leads to a stop of the app. Debug information will be printed into the output.log file of the plc.

`/opt/plcnext/logs/output.log`

-----------
### Publish_data

Publish_data must be an array of objects with the following properties:

Name     | Required | JSON type        | Description
:---     | :---     | :---             | :---
port     | Yes      | string           | The 'OUT' port from which data will be published<sup>1</sup>.

**Note:**
1. Ports published from PLCnext Engineer projects must be specified in the following format:

   *Arp.Plc.Eclr/ProgramInstance.PortName*

   ... where *ProgramInstance* must be the name of the program instance in the PLCnext Engineer project, and *PortName* must the name of an OUT port variable defined in that program.
1. The MQTT app version 1.1 does only support QoS 0
1. The MQTT app version 1.1 does not support 'retained'.


#### Publish_data configuration example
The following example shows how a valid configuration.

**Note:** Make sure that the assigned GDS port exist and that the data type is correct. A wrong configruation will prevent the app from starting.

   ```json
    "publish_data":[{
      "port"   : "Arp.Plc.Eclr/TestBench1.PubLoadTestBool",
      "qos": 0,
      "retained": false,
      "topics" :[
        "LoadTestBool"
      ]
    }
```


-----------
### Subscribe_data

subscribe_data must be an array of objects with the following properties:

Name     | Required | JSON type        | Description
:---     | :---     | :---             | :---
topic    | Yes      | string           | This topic is subscribed Message are published to all these topics.
ports    | Yes      | array of strings | The 'IN' ports to which subscription data will be written<sup>1</sup>.

**Note:**
1. Ports in PLCnext Engineer projects that subscribe to MQTT topics must be specified in the following format:

   *Arp.Plc.Eclr/ProgramInstance.PortName*

   ... where *ProgramInstance* must be the name of the program instance in the PLCnext Engineer project, and *PortName* must the name of an IN port variable defined in that program.

#### Subscribe_data configuration example
The following example shows how a valid configuration.

**Note:** Make sure that the assigned GDS port exist and that the data type is correct. A wrong configruation will prevent the app from starting.

   ```json
"subscribe_data":[{
      "topic" : "LoadTestBool",
      "ports" :[
        "Arp.Plc.Eclr/TestBench1.SubLoadTestBool"
      ]
    }
```

### Configuration examples
A complete configuration example can be found [here](https://github.com/PLCnext/MqttGdsConnector/tree/master/examples).  
Remember that your own configuration file must **always** be named `mqtt_gds.settings.json`.

-----------
## Known issues and limitations
* Only one client, and one concurrent server connection, is currently supported
* When the network connection to the broker is lost and restored, and a manual or automatic reconnect is triggered, the MQTT Client will block for precisely the number of milliseconds specified by the broker "timeout" property (default: 300 seconds).
* Complex data types (including Arrays and Structures) are not currently supported.
* Only QoS 0 is supported
* The app checks the assigned GDS port in terms of availability and type during then start-up process. Any changes (delete, rename or type) during operation (download a modified project without stopping and rebooting the PLC) can lead to an undifiend behaviour!

-----------
## Error handling 
The app logs the complete startup, connection and error history into the output.log file (`/opt/plcnext/logs/output.log`) of the PLC which gives the user a reliable indication of the current state of the app.
In addition, a status port can be configured (please refer the chapter 'broker properties'). The value *true* indicates that the app was successfully started (configuration correct) and that connection to the configured MQTT Broker could be established. The values goes to *false* when the app could not be startet (wrong configuration) or when the connection to the MQTT Broker could not be established or is interrupted.

**Note:** Phoenix Contact strongly recommend the usage of the "status_port".

### Diagnostic Log
This chapter explains the most important diagnostic messages and is intended to support troubleshooting the MQTT app.

All diagnostics are printed in the output.log file (`/opt/plcnext/logs/output.log`).

In the following is a positive stat up of the app logged and described.

```
PxceTcs.Mqtt.GdsConnectorComponent    INFO  - Loaded configuration from file: /opt/plcnext/projects/MqttClient/mqtt_gds.settings.json  
PxceTcs.Mqtt.GdsConnectorComponent    INFO  - Loaded configuration schema.  
```
The configuration was loaded successfully, no schema violations were detected.

**Note:** Every schema violations (missing json seperators or missing mandatory fields) will lead to an error at this position.
The message indicates the kind of the error.

```
PxceTcs.Mqtt.GdsConnectorComponent    INFO  - No reconnect port has been specified.  
PxceTcs.Mqtt.GdsConnectorComponent    INFO  - Created MQTT Client with ID: 56022  
PxceTcs.Mqtt.GdsConnectorComponent    INFO  - No MQTT SSL/TLS Options provided. Defaults will be used.  
PxceTcs.MqttClient.MqttClientManager  INFO  - Connecting to MQTT server  
PxceTcs.MqttClient.MqttClientManager  INFO  - Connected  
PxceTcs.Mqtt.GdsConnectorComponent    INFO  - Connected to MQTT Client 56022
```
After the configuration was loaded, generates the MQTT client a random client ID and tries to connect with the defined MQTT Broker.

**Note:** Connection or certification problems will lead to an error at this position.

```
PxceTcs.Mqtt.GdsConnectorComponent    INFO  - Subscribed to MQTT topic LoadTestBool  
PxceTcs.Mqtt.GdsConnectorComponent    INFO  - Subscribed to MQTT topic LoadTestBool1  
PxceTcs.Mqtt.GdsConnectorComponent    INFO  - SetupConfig(): Worker thread has been started. 
```
As sooon as the connection is valid will the MQTT Client start to publish and subscribe the configured topics.
The cyclic update is performed with the worker thread (500ms), the app is running.


## How to get support
The MQTT Client app is supported in the forum of the [PLCnext Community](http://plcnext-community.net).
Please raise an issue with a detailed error description and paste always the output.log file.
