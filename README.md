## Description

MQTT GDS Connector is a PLCnext Technology component, that exchanges data between Global Data Space (GDS) ports and MQTT server topics. 

![PLCnext Engineer Port Example](images/PLCnEng_Port_Example.jpg)

The component is configured with the file `mqtt_gds.settings.json` which is stored localy on the device. 

```json
{ "brokers":[{
    "host": "tcp://test.mosquitto.org:1883",
    "client_name": "MQTT_Test_App",
	"status_port": "Arp.Plc.Eclr/TestBench1.MQTT_Broker_Status",
    "connect_options":{
      "will_options":{
        "topic": "last_will_topic",
        "payload": "auf wiedersehen"
      }
    },
    "publish_data":[{
      "port"   : "Arp.Plc.Eclr/TestBench1.PubLoadTestBool",
      "qos": 0,
      "retained": false,
      "topics" :[
        "LoadTestBool"
      ]
    }
],
    "subscribe_data":[{
      "topic" : "LoadTestBool",
      "ports" :[
        "Arp.Plc.Eclr/TestBench1.SubLoadTestBool"
      ]
    }
]
  }]
}
```

The entries in this file must conform to the defined JSON schema. Ff not will the app not start and post an error desciption in the output.log file which can be found in the following directory on the device.

/opt/plcnext/logs/output.log

The MQTT GDS Connector uses the Remote Service Call (RSC) service published by the MQTT Client component, which must be running on the target. 


## Requirements

* AXC F 2152 with minimum firmware version 2019.3
* Valid account for the PLCnext Store with payment credentials (not needed for the trial version)
* The PLCnext Control must be connected to the internet and must be registered in the PLCnext Store

## Features

* The MQTT Client app is compatible with version 3.1 and 3.1.1
* Support of TCP and Websockets over an unencrypted or an encrypted (SSL/TLS) connection
* Automatic reconnect to the MQTT Broker
* Easy handling due to GDS port mapping, no further configuration effort
* Cyclic update of Publish Topics, individually adjustable (minimum 500ms)
* Support of the following data types (Bool, Int8, Int16, Int32, Int64, Uint8, Uint16, Uint32, Uint64, Real32, Real64, String*, DateTime)


**String data is always published with a terminating NULL character. When subscribing to String data, incoming message payloads must always include a terminating NULL character.*


## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome.

## Building from source

Building from source requires the PLCnext SDK for your target. It is strongly recommended that you use the PLCnext Command Line Interface (CLI) to install and manage PLCnext SDKs on your host. Assistance with this is available from the [PLCnext Community]((https://plcnext-community.net)).

An example of a build session is as follows:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/PLCnext/MqttGdsConnector
$ cd MqttGdsConnector
$ cmake -G "Ninja" 
> -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/opt/pxc/sdk/AXCF2152/2019.3/toolchain.cmake
> -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF
> -DUSE_ARP_DEVICE=ON
> -DCMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX=/home/tcs-user/Documents/projects/MqttGdsConnector/bin/axcf2152
> -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local
> -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/home/tcs-user/Documents/projects/MqttGdsConnector/external/deploy/axcf2152
> -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON
> -DARP_TOOLCHAIN_ROOT=/opt/pxc/sdk/AXCF2152/2019.3
> -DARP_DEVICE=AXCF2152 "-DARP_DEVICE_VERSION=2019.3 (19.3.0.18161)"
> -S . -B ./build/axcf2152-2019.3
$ cmake --build /home/tcs-user/Documents/projects/MqttGdsConnector/build/axcf2152-2019.3 --config Debug --target all -- -j 3
$ cmake --build /home/tcs-user/Documents/projects/MqttGdsConnector/build/axcf2152-2019.3 --config Debug --target install -- -j 3
```

## Installing manualy
**Note** The follwoing steps are only needed when you build the application by yourself without using the PLCnext Store. Phoenix Contact recommend the usage of the PLCnext Store.


1. Copy the contents of `external/deploy/axcf2152` to `/usr/local` on the target.
1. Copy `libGdsConnector.so` to `/usr/local/lib` on the target.
1. Copy `libs/MqttGdsConnector.acf.config` to `/opt/plcnext/projects/Default` on the target.
1. Copy the file `mqtt_gds.schema.json` to `/opt/plcnext/apps/60002172000048/` on the target.
1. Copy a valid configuration file named `mqtt_gds.settings.json` to `/opt/plcnext/projects/MqttClient` on the target.
1. Reboot the target.

## Quick start

This example exchanges data between a PLC (MQTT Client) and an iPhone* or iPad* (both MQTT Clients) via a public MQTT broker, over an unencrypted connection. It requires a PLC that is connected to the internet, and a PC with access to both the PLC and the internet. For this example, the PC must have PLCnext Engineer software installed.

**There are many other free MQTT Test Clients for Android, Windows or Linux available*


1. Make sure that your AXC F 2152 has a firmware >=2019.3 and that it has an internet connection
1. Register yourself and your AXC F 2152 in the PLCnext Store (www.plcnextstore.com) - not necessary when the app is installed manualy
1. Deploy the app via the PLCnext Store (recommend) or manualy
1. Create an IEC 61131 project in PLCnext Engineer version 2019.3, with the following configuration:
   - One AXC F 2152 PLC with firmware version >=2019.0
   - one program called "Main"
   - one program OUT port called "PubMessage" of type STRING
   - one program IN port called "SubMessage" of type STRING
   - one instance of the Main program, called "MainInstance"
1. Download the PLCnext Engineer project to the PLC.
1. Go online to the PLC and change the value of the "PubMessage" variable in the "MainInstance" program instance.
1. Install the [MQTTool app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mqttool/id1085976398) on an iPhone or iPad.
1. Open the MQTTool app and connect to the public Mosquitto test broker (test.mosquitto.org, port 1883).
1. On a PC, create a text file named `mqtt_gds.settings.json`, containing the following configuration:

   ```json
   {
     "brokers":[{
       "host": "tcp://test.mosquitto.org:1883",
       "client_name": "MyPLCnext",
       "connect_options":{
         "will_options":{
           "topic": "last_will_topic",
           "payload": "auf wiedersehen"
         }
       },
       "publish_data":[{
         "port"   : "Arp.Plc.Eclr/MainInstance.PubMessage",
         "qos"    : 0,
         "retained": false,
         "topics" :[
           "MyPubTopic"
         ]
       }],
       "subscribe_data":[{
         "topic" : "MySubTopic",
         "ports" :[
           "Arp.Plc.Eclr/MainInstance.SubMessage"
         ]
       }]
     }]
   }
   ```
   In the configuration file, change the `client_name` property to a value that is likely to be unique on a public server.

   Change the publish and subscribe `topic` properties to values that are likely to be unique on a public server.
1. Using WinSCP (Windows) or `scp` (Linux), copy the `mqtt_gds.settings.json` file to the following directory on the PLC: `/opt/plcnext/projects/MqttClient/`. Create this directory on the PLC if it does not exist already.

   The default login credentials for the PLC are:
   - User name : admin
   - Password  : &lt;printed on the PLC housing&gt;


1. Restart the PLC.
1. In the MQTTool app on the iPhone or iPad, subscribe to the topic name that was entered in the `publish_data` section of the configuration file (e.g. "MyPubTopic").
1. The messages received on the iPhone or iPad now show the value of the PubMessage variable in the PLC.
1. On the iPhone or iPad, publish a message to the topic that was entered in the `subscribe_data` section of the configuration file (e.g. "MySubTopic"). This message now appears as the value of the SubMessage variable in the PLC.


## Configuration reference

The MQTT GDS Client is configured with the file `mqtt_gds.settings.json`. This file must be located in the following directory on the PLC:

`/opt/plcnext/projects/MqttClient/`

This directory must be created on the PLC if it does not exist already.

For encrypted connections, a server certificate, client certificate and client private key may be required. These files should be copied to the PLC using WinSCP (Windows) or scp (Linux). The user is free to place these files anywhere on the PLC file system. The absolute path to these files must then be specified in the relevant `ssl_options` configuration fields.

After modifying any of these files, the PLCnext Runtime must be restarted.


### Configuration file details

The configuration file `mqtt_gds.settings.json` must comply with the JSON schema defined in the file `mqtt_gds.schema.json`. This schema file must be located in the following directory on the PLC:

`/opt/plcnext/apps/60002172000048/`

A valid configuration consists of an array of broker objects. Each broker object represents one MQTT client-broker connection.

The following is a list of all available broker properties. Optional properties that do not appear in the configuration file will be given default values.

NOTE: If the application encounters any error during startup, then it will immediately stop. For example, any error in the configuration, including missing GDS ports or GDS ports with unsupported types, will halt the application. In this case, check the Ouput.log file for a description of the error. After the error is corrected, the PLC must be restarted.

## Error handling 
kommt noch

## Known issues and limitations
* Only one client, and one concurrent server connection, is currently supported
* When the network connection to the broker is lost and restored, and a manual or automatic reconnect is triggered, the MQTT Client will block for precisely the number of milliseconds specified by the broker "timeout" property (default: 300 seconds).
* Complex data types (including Arrays and Structures) are not currently supported.
