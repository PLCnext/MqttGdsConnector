## Description

MQTT GDS Connector is a PLCnext Technology component that that exchanges data between Global Data Space (GDS) ports and MQTT server topics. The component is configured with the file `mqtt_gds.settings.json`. Data in this file must conform to a defined JSON schema.

The MQTT GDS Connector uses the Remote Service Call (RSC) service published by the MQTT Client component, which must be running on the target. 


## Requirements

This component is designed for the AXC F 2152 controller with minimum firmware version 2019.3.


## Features

The component can connect to a single MQTT broker using TCP or WebSockets, over an unencrypted or an encrypted (SSL/TLS) connection.

Only one client, and one concurrent server connection, is currently supported.

The client will publish the value of all configured GDS ports at a fixed frequency of 500ms. Data from each GDS port can be published to multiple MQTT topics.

The client will subscribe to all configured MQTT topics. The payload from any new message on a subscribed MQTT topic can be written to one or more GDS ports.

There are no checks done on incoming MQTT message payloads. It is the users responsibility to ensure that messages on each subscribed topic contain payload data that is compatible with all the GDS ports associated with that subscription.

The following GDS data types are currently supported: Bool, Int8, Int16, Int32, Int64, Uint8, Uint16, Uint32, Uint64, Real32, Real64, String, DateTime.

'String' data is always published with a terminating NULL character.

When subscribing to 'String' data, incoming message payloads must always include a terminating NULL character.

Complex data types (including Arrays and Structures) are not currently supported.


## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome.

## Building from source

Building from source requires the PLCnext SDK for your target. It is strongly recommended that you use the PLCnext Command Line Interface (CLI) to install and manage PLCnext SDKs on your host. Assistance with this is available from the [PLCnext Community]((https://plcnext-community.net)).

An example of a build session is as follows:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/PLCnext/MqttGdsConnector
$ cd MqttGdsConnector
$ cmake -G "Ninja" 
> -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/opt/pxc/sdk/AXCF2152/2019.3/toolchain.cmake
> -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF
> -DUSE_ARP_DEVICE=ON
> -DCMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX=/home/tcs-user/Documents/projects/MqttGdsConnector/bin/axcf2152
> -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local
> -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/home/tcs-user/Documents/projects/MqttGdsConnector/external/deploy/axcf2152
> -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON
> -DARP_TOOLCHAIN_ROOT=/opt/pxc/sdk/AXCF2152/2019.3
> -DARP_DEVICE=AXCF2152 "-DARP_DEVICE_VERSION=2019.3 (19.3.0.18161)"
> -S . -B ./build/axcf2152-2019.3
$ cmake --build /home/tcs-user/Documents/projects/MqttGdsConnector/build/axcf2152-2019.3 --config Debug --target all -- -j 3
$ cmake --build /home/tcs-user/Documents/projects/MqttGdsConnector/build/axcf2152-2019.3 --config Debug --target install -- -j 3
```

## Installing

Copy the contents of `external/deploy/axcf2152` to `/usr/local` on the target.

Copy `libGdsConnector.so` to `/usr/local/lib` on the target.

Copy `libs/MqttGdsConnector.acf.config` to `/opt/plcnext/projects/Default` on the target.

Copy the file `mqtt_gds.schema.json` to `/opt/plcnext/apps/60002172000048/` on the target.

Copy a valid configuration file named `mqtt_gds.settings.json` to `/opt/plcnext/projects/MqttClient` on the target.

Reboot the target.

## Quick start

This example exchanges data between a PLC and an iPhone or iPad via a public MQTT broker, over an unencrypted connection. It requires a PLC that is connected to the internet, and a PC with access to both the PLC and the internet. For this example, the PC must have PLCnext Engineer software installed.

1. Create an IEC 61131 project in PLCnext Engineer version 2019.3, with the following features:
   - One AXC F 2152 PLC with firmware version 2019.3
   - one program called "Main"
   - one program OUT port called "PubMessage" of type STRING
   - one program IN port called "SubMessage" of type STRING
   - one instance of the Main program, called "MainInstance"

1. Download the PLCnext Engineer project to the PLC.

1. Go online to the PLC and change the value of the "PubMessage" variable in the "MainInstance" program instance.

1. Install the [MQTTool app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mqttool/id1085976398) on an iPhone or iPad.

1. Open the MQTTool app and connect to the public Mosquitto test broker (test.mosquitto.org, port 1883).

1. On a PC, create a text file named `mqtt_gds.settings.json`, containing the following configuration:

   ```json
   {
     "brokers":[{
       "host": "tcp://test.mosquitto.org:1883",
       "client_name": "MyPLCnext",
       "connect_options":{
         "will_options":{
           "topic": "last_will_topic",
           "payload": "auf wiedersehen"
         }
       },
       "publish_data":[{
         "port"   : "Arp.Plc.Eclr/MainInstance.PubMessage",
         "topics" :[
           "MyPubTopic"
         ]
       }],
       "subscribe_data":[{
         "topic" : "MySubTopic",
         "ports" :[
           "Arp.Plc.Eclr/MainInstance.SubMessage"
         ]
       }]
     }]
   }
   ```
   In the configuration file, change the `client_name` property to a value that is likely to be unique on a public server.

   Change the publish and subscribe `topic` properties to values that are likely to be unique on a public server.

1. Using WinSCP (Windows) or `scp` (Linux), copy the `mqtt_gds.settings.json` file to the following directory on the PLC: `/opt/plcnext/projects/MqttClient/`. Create this directory on the PLC if it does not exist already.

   The default login credentials for the PLC are:
   - User name : admin
   - Password  : &lt;printed on the PLC housing&gt;

   Make sure that the file has 'read' privileges for all users on the PLC.

1. Restart the PLC.

1. In the MQTTool app on the iPhone or iPad, subscribe to the topic name that was entered in the `publish_data` section of the configuration file (e.g. "MyPubTopic").

1. The messages received on the iPhone or iPad now show the value of the PubMessage variable in the PLC.

1. On the iPhone or iPad, publish a message to the topic that was entered in the `subscribe_data` section of the configuration file (e.g. "MySubTopic"). This message now appears as the value of the SubMessage variable in the PLC.


## Configuration reference

The MQTT GDS Client is configured with the file `mqtt_gds.settings.json`. This file must be located in the following directory on the PLC:

`/opt/plcnext/projects/MqttClient/`

This directory must be created on the PLC if it does not exist already.

For encrypted connections, a server certificate, client certificate and client private key may be required. These files should be copied to the PLC using WinSCP (Windows) or scp (Linux). The user is free to place these files anywhere on the PLC file system. The absolute path to these files must then be specified in the relevant `ssl_options` configuration fields.

After modifying any of these files, the PLCnext Runtime must be restarted.


### Configuration file details

The configuration file `mqtt_gds.settings.json` must comply with the JSON schema defined in the file `mqtt_gds.schema.json`. This schema file must be located in the following directory on the PLC:

`/opt/plcnext/apps/60002172000048/`

A valid configuration consists of an array of broker objects. Each broker object represents one MQTT client-broker connection.

The following is a list of all available broker properties. Optional properties that do not appear in the configuration file will be given default values.

### Configuration examples

Examples of configuration files that you can use as a starting point for your own project are available [here](https://github.com/PLCnext/MqttGdsConnector/tree/master/examples). Remember that your own configuration file must *always* be named `mqtt_gds.settings.json`.


## Known issues

If the connection to the broker is lost, the client will attempt to reconnect, but will eventually give up. In this case, the PLC must be restarted in order to trigger more connection attempts.
